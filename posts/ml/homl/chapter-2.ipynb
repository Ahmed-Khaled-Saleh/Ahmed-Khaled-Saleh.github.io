One such metric is the **representativeness** of it, which means that your test set should resemble the original data as much as possible. The test set should be kept aside until the end of the project to avoid the **data snooping bias**.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, what is The **data snooping bias**? It is when you look at the test set and you tweak your model to perform better on the test set. This is not a good practice because you are not supposed to look at the test set until the end of the project. \n",
