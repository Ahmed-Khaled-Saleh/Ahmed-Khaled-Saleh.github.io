This is my personal place on the internet where I create technical content and write about topics that I like and find interesting. I like to write because I first like it, and second, I want to see the gap in my knowledge when I write about something. My main area of interest lies in the intersection between computer science, mathematics, and artificial intelligence. I also like history, philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience."
